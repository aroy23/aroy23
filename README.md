Hi, I'm Arnav, an undergraduate computer science student at UCLA, and I love programming.<br>
##
I'm broadly interested in the fields of backend, automation software, artificial intelligence, and performance optimization.

- I'm currently researching techniques to embed financial time-series data for efficient indexing and identification of recurring market patterns through [LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory) autoencoders and unsupervised representation learning.

- I recently developed a backend pipeline at Ricoh USA to optimize metadata ingestion for [RAG](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) systems handling technical company documents

- I'll be joining Amazon this summer as a Software Development Engineer Intern.
