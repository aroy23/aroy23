Hi! I'm Arnav, an undergraduate computer science student at UCLA, and I love programming.<br>
##
I'm broadly interested in the fields of backend, automation software, artificial intelligence, and performance optimization.

- I'm currently interning at Amazon this summer as a Software Engineer Intern automating payments for delivery partners through optical character recognition and AI agents

- I'm currently researching techniques to embed financial time-series data for efficient indexing and identification of recurring market patterns through LSTM autoencoders and unsupervised representation learning.

- I recently developed a backend pipeline at Ricoh USA to optimize metadata ingestion for RAG systems handling technical company documents
