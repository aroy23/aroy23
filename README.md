## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Arnav an undergraduate student at UCLA studying computer science.

I love exploring complex computational intricacies in all software I work on.

I recently implemented [retrieval-augmented generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) for a generative AI support agent at Ricoh USA.

I'm broadly interested in the fields of high-performance computing, robotics & transportation software, computer vision, and artificial intelligence.
