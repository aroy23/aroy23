## Hi there 👋
I'm Arnav, an undergraduate student at UCLA studying computer science.

I love exploring complex computational intricacies in all software I work on.

I recently implemented [retrieval-augmented generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retrieval-augmented_generation) for a generative AI support agent at Ricoh USA.

I'm broadly interested in the fields of performance optimization, backend, automation software, and computer vision.
